1.  What is this folder?

3.  How do you use this folder?

    This folder corresponds to Assignment B1 and contains the source code.
    Create/initiate a pull request to obtain the file and run the code.
    The required packages may need to be installed and data needs to be read into R, but once this is
    done all the code should work. Run the code in an Rmd file and knit the Rmd file to
    create an md file to ensure that it all works. Commit the changes
    and push the updated files and folders. You can view the source code directly on github or through downloading the
    files.
